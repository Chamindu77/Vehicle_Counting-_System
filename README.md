# Vehicle_Counting _System
 Artificial Intelligence - Computer Vision Project

## Introduction

Vehicle Counting using OpenCV is an application that utilizes computer vision techniques to count vehicles passing through a specified area captured by a webcam or a video feed. This project detects vehicles in real-time, tracks their movement, and increments a counter every time a vehicle crosses a predefined line.

## Features

Real-time Vehicle Detection: The application detects vehicles in real-time using computer vision algorithms.

Vehicle Tracking: It tracks the movement of vehicles to determine when they cross a predefined counting line.

Automatic Counting: A counter increments every time a vehicle crosses the counting line, providing accurate vehicle count information.

User-friendly Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface displaying the live video feed along with the vehicle count.
